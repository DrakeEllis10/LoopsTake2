# Distance Traveled
# The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: distance = speed * time
# For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled
# is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles
# per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display
# the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example
# of the desired output:
# Hour            Distance Traveled
# ----------------------------------
#   1                   40
#   2                   80
#   3                   120
